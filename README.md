# Drink Recipes Menu

## Introduction

This project is part of the **Foundations Course** from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). It is designed to practice HTML fundamentals, incluing elements, tags, text formatting, lists, links, and images.

While the original project focuses on food recipes, I decided to create **drink recipes menu** instead. I will also be adding CSS styling to improve the presentation, even though this section of the course primarily focuses on HTML.

## Design Inspiration

The concept for this project comes from my new interest in matcha and coffee. I have always enjoyed how coffee shop menus have a unqiue aesthetic that matches the vibe of the shop. My goal is to recreate a minimal, clean drink menu inspired by minimalism.

## To-Do

- [X] Create an HTML structure of the menu design
- [X] Style the HTML with CSS to match design in Figma
- [X] Add relative links to each drink on the menu
- [X] Create HTML structure for each drink recipe
- [X] Style each recipe page

## Skills Practiced

In this mini project, I practiced:
- Structuring webpages with semantic HTML  
- Creating both ordered and unordered lists  
- Applying basic CSS styling for layout and design  
- Working with images and using descriptive alt text  
- Designing wireframes in Figma to guide the website’s layout and style

## Project Goal

    - To create a minimal menu for a coffee shop showcasing their drinks
    - To adding links to the menu for users to learn how to make each drink on the menu
    - Experiement with the CSS styling, typography, and design process

## Reflection

One thing I learned from this project is that your wireframes and designs may not always turn out exactly as you first imagined. It’s okay to start with something simple and then improve it as your skills grow, experimenting with new colors, ideas, and structures along the way.  

Although I had some prior knowledge of HTML and CSS, this project helped me practice them more intentionally, especially in understanding how to properly structure and format HTML. CSS is still a bit confusing for me, particularly when working with Flexbox and Grid, but I enjoyed the challenge and found the process rewarding.
