# Drink Recipes Menu

## Introduction

This project is part of the **Foundations Course** from [The Odin Project](https://ww.theodinproject.com/). It is designed to practice HTML fundamentals, incluing elements, tags, text formatting, lists, links, and images.

While the original project focuses on food recipes, I decided to create **drink recipes menu** instead. I will also be adding CSS stling to improve the presentation, even though this section of the course primarily focuses on HTML.

## Design Inspiration

The concept for this project comes from my new interest in matcha and coffee. I have always enjoyed how coffee shop menus have a unqiue aesthetic that matches the vibe of the shop. My goal is to recreate a minimal, clean drink menu inspired by minimalism.

## Skills Practiced

## Project Goal

    - To create a minimal menu for a coffee shop showcasing their drinks
    - To adding links to the menu for users to learn how to make each drink on the menu
    - Experiement with the CSS styling, typography, and design process
